Hi there, thanks for reading this!

I want to give HUGE credit to the following repositories that helped me a lot to understand how memory was managed inside the roblox process:
  https://github.com/RajkoRSL/python-external-roblox
  https://github.com/ElCapor/bloxlib
  https://github.com/justDarian/hyperinjector
Also shoutout to https://github.com/NtReadVirtualMemory for roblox's memory offsets

NOTE: THE SEARCH FEATURE IS VERY BUGGY PLS FORGIVE ME!!!!!!!!
