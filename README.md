PyRoblox (pyrblx) is a tool made to explore roblox's process memory in an attempt to observe how the data is structured and managed in roblox games.
This tool is not intended for hacking (well it kinda is).

IMPORTANT:
  I want to give HUGE credit to the following repositories that helped me a lot to understand how memory was managed inside the roblox process:
    https://github.com/RajkoRSL/python-external-roblox
    https://github.com/ElCapor/bloxlib
    https://github.com/justDarian/hyperinjector
  Also shoutout to https://github.com/NtReadVirtualMemory for roblox's memory offsets

NOTES:
  THE SEARCH FEATURE IS VERY BUGGY PLS FORGIVE ME!!!!!!!!
