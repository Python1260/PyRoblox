#  PyRoblox

**PyRoblox** (`pyrblx`) is a tool made to explore **roblox's process memory** in an attempt to observe how the data is structured and managed in roblox games.
This tool is not intended for hacking!
*(well it kinda is)*

## Features
  - Retrieve the **DataModel** and **VisualEngine** from a roblox process
  - Explore almost all the untouched assets of a specific game
  - Partially recover content from **LocalScripts** and **ModuleScripts**
  - Search for assets using *name*, *type* and *memory address*

## Usage
  - to-do

## IMPORTANT
  I want to give **HUGE** credit to the following repositories that helped me a lot to understand how memory was managed inside the roblox process:
    - https://github.com/RajkoRSL/python-external-roblox
    - https://github.com/ElCapor/bloxlib
    - https://github.com/justDarian/hyperinjector
  *Also shoutout to https://github.com/NtReadVirtualMemory for roblox's memory offsets*

## NOTES
  - THE SEARCH FEATURE IS VERY BUGGY PLS FORGIVE ME!!!!!!!!
